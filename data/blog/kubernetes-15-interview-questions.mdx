## Answers

### Answer 1: 
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It solves problems related to managing large numbers of containers, including automated rollouts and rollbacks, scaling, service discovery, load balancing, and ensuring high availability and resource optimization.

### Answer 2:
Kubernetes has a master-worker architecture. The key components include:\
**Master Node:** Manages the cluster and consists of the API Server, etcd (key-value store), Scheduler, Controller Manager, and Cloud Controller Manager.\
**Worker Nodes:** Run the containerized applications and consist of Kubelet (agent running on each node), Kube-proxy (handles network routing), and the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd).

### Answer 3:
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process in the cluster. It can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage. Unlike individual containers, Pods provide a higher level of abstraction, encapsulating an applicationâ€™s containers, storage resources, a unique network IP, and options for how the containers should run.

### Answer 4:
Deployments manage the desired state of application replicas. They provide declarative updates to applications, enabling rolling updates and rollbacks. Key benefits include automated updates, versioning, scaling, and ensuring the specified number of replicas is running at all times.

### Answer 5:
Services in Kubernetes are abstractions that define a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them. They enable communication by providing stable IP addresses and DNS names, facilitating load balancing, and ensuring that communication endpoints remain consistent even if the underlying Pods change.

### Answer 6:
Namespaces are virtual clusters within a physical Kubernetes cluster, providing a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams. Use cases include resource isolation, managing different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), and controlling resource quotas and access policies.

### Answer 7:
ConfigMaps and Secrets are Kubernetes objects used to manage configuration data. ConfigMaps store non-sensitive information, while Secrets store sensitive data such as passwords and API keys. Both can be injected into Pods as environment variables or mounted as files.

### Answer 8:
Kubernetes handles resource management by allocating CPU, memory, and other resources to Pods based on their specified requests and limits. The scheduler places Pods on nodes that meet their resource requirements and constraints, considering factors like node capacity, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and taints/tolerations.

### Answer 9:
The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for assigning newly created Pods to suitable nodes. It determines pod placement by evaluating resource requirements, constraints, and policies such as NodeSelector, Affinity/Anti-Affinity, and Taints/Tolerations. The goal is to optimize resource utilization and meet the specified scheduling criteria.

### Answer 10:
**NodeSelector:** A simple way to constrain Pods to run only on nodes with specific labels.\
**Affinity/Anti-Affinity:** Provide more complex rules for pod placement based on labels, allowing Pods to prefer (affinity) or avoid (anti-affinity) co-location with other Pods. These can be specified as required or preferred rules.

### Answer 11:
Taints are applied to nodes to mark them as having special conditions that should prevent certain Pods from being scheduled on them. Tolerations are applied to Pods to allow them to schedule on nodes with matching taints. This mechanism is used to control and isolate workloads based on node conditions.

### Answer 12:
Rolling updates are performed using Deployments by updating the deployment configuration with a new image version or configuration change. Kubernetes gradually replaces old Pods with new ones, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal downtime. Rollbacks can be performed by reverting the Deployment to a previous revision using `kubectl rollout undo`.

### Answer 13:
StatefulSets manage stateful applications by providing stable network identities, persistent storage, and ordered deployment and scaling of Pods. Unlike Deployments, which are suitable for stateless applications, StatefulSets ensure that each Pod has a unique and persistent identity and storage.

### Answer 14:
Monitoring and logging in Kubernetes can be achieved using tools like Prometheus (for metrics collection and alerting), Grafana (for visualization), and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for logging. Kubernetes also integrates with cloud provider monitoring solutions.

### Answer 15:
Strategies for scaling applications in Kubernetes include:\
**Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** Automatically scales the number of Pods based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.\
**Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA):** Adjusts the resource requests and limits of containers to optimize resource utilization.\
**Cluster Autoscaler:** Adds or removes nodes from the cluster based on the pending pod demand.
