## WHOAMI

I'm a Software Developer with over five years of professional experience. My main playground is the **TypeScript** ecosystem, where I love building robust applications using mainly **Node.js** and **Nest.js**. In the past, I’ve also developed backend systems with **Java** and **Spring Boot**.

Currently, I'm diving into **Elixir** and the **Phoenix** framework at my job. Exploring functional programming has been a breath of fresh air. It challenges my thinking and offers elegant solutions that differ from the object-oriented approach I started with.

I began my journey in Frontend development, but over time, I found my true passion in the backend. In the last couple of years, I've also grown deeply into the world of **DevOps**. I enjoy crafting automated CI/CD pipelines, setting up development workflows, managing containerized applications (with **Kubernetes**—where it makes sense), and ensuring systems are reliable and scalable. 

I'm also working daily with **AWS**, continuously expanding my skills in cloud technologies.

## BLOG

I created this blog to share what I learn and to give something back to the developer community. Writing is also a great way for me to organize my thoughts and express my passion, hopefully in ways that can inspire or help others on their own paths.

## PASSION

What excites me most about software development is the freedom to build things without limits. Taking an idea from concept to reality and seeing it become something people use—is deeply satisfying. That’s also why I love tinkering and building in my free time.

I believe everyone has a personal calling. For me, it's building and creating things that have purpose and impact. My journey has taken me through many paths, but software development is where I’ve found my place and my potential. It feels like discovering a secret language where I can express myself fully.

Outside of coding, I love spending time with my wife and son, hitting a **CrossFit** session, cooking, reading, or getting out into nature to recharge.
