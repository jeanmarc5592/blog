I am a Fullstack Software Developer with experience of half a decade. The whole Typescript ecosystem is my home turf, where I love to build aplications using mainly React, Nest.js or Next.js.

Furthermore I also love to expand my knowledge in DevOps practices and software architecture topics. I think these are important components to understand the bigger picture about a software.

Currently I'm working at [JaStech GmbH](https://jastech-solutions.de/home) as a Fullstack Developer. We're building tailored software solutions for other companies to make their businesses more productive and to stand out from their competitors.

What fascinates me most about software development is the fact that I can build stuff without limitations. Planning and turning an idea into a usable application is really satisfying for me. That's the reason why I also love to build stuff in my freetime.

When I'm not coding or learning new stuff, I enjoy being together with my wife and son or to hit a CrossFit workout. Cooking, reading and being in nature are ways for me to bring balance into my life.
